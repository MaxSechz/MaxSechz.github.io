      <p class="blurb">
        I am a web developer based in New York.

        I don't like it when things are described as impossible.

        Programming is my way of taking things from the impossible pile, and putting them in the awesome pile.

        You can see my skills below, but if you want to see what I am capable of, what I can make possible, check out my portfolio.

                StudyBlocks is a collaborative online studying platform that allows anyone to take their flashcards anywhere.
                Users can create decks of flashcards to study from, using either text or images for the front of the card.
                They can then take practice tests generated from their cards.
                StudyBlocks tracks users' scores and displays them on interactive charts, allowing users to see their progress over time.
                StudyBlocks also offers registration with schools and courses, allowing users access to the decks of their classmates.
                Together, a class can generate an enormous amount of material, making learning a team effort.

                Blake is a modern, browser based game, written in JavaScript and inspired by the arcade classic, Snake.
                Players control Blake using the arrow keys, and attempt to eat as many oranges as possible without running Blake into himself.
                The development of Blake was a challenge in using only jQuery to create a highly dynamic, interactive experience.
                Creating a functional game was a relatively simple task, however the real challenge was creating the appearance of movement and smooth animation.
                Clever, dynamic manipulation of HTML elements with different CSS classes, all facilitated by jQuery, resulted in a pleasing and fun tribute to the first video game I ever played.

                This is a terminal based chess game written in ruby.
                It supports two human players, a human versus a computer, and even computer versus computer games.
                All standard legal moves are possible, including castling, pawn promotion, and en passant.
                Moves are entered using algebraic chess notation.
                Incorrect movement will inform the player whether the space selected was empty, contained an enemy piece, or was a friendly piece that could not move.
                Wins, losses, as well as stalemates result in game termination.
                Additionally, games can be saved and loaded, allowing players to preserve developed game states and play them again.
